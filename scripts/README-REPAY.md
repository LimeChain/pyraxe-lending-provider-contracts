# Repay Loan Script

Repay borrowed tokens to an Aave V2 lending pool, reducing debt and improving health factor.

## Purpose

This script allows you to:
- Repay borrowed tokens (full or partial)
- Reduce your debt and interest payments
- Improve your health factor
- Free up borrowing capacity

## Prerequisites

- **Active debt** - Must have borrowed tokens first
- Tokens to repay (in your wallet)
- Configured `.env` file
- For Sepolia: ETH for gas fees

## Configuration

Set these variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Repay amount
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=0  # 0 = repay all, or specify amount

# Interest rate mode (must match your debt type)
INTEREST_RATE_MODE=2  # 1 = stable, 2 = variable

# Network and addresses
NETWORK=localhost  # or 'sepolia'
LOCAL_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS=0x...
SEPOLIA_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Usage

### Full Repayment (All Debt)

```bash
# In .env:
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=0

# Run script:
npx hardhat run scripts/repay-loan-configurable.ts --network localhost
# or
npx hardhat run scripts/repay-loan-configurable.ts --network sepolia
```

### Partial Repayment

```bash
# In .env:
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=50  # Repay only 50 tokens

# Run script:
npx hardhat run scripts/repay-loan-configurable.ts --network sepolia
```

## What Happens

1. **Checks debt** - Validates you have debt to repay
2. **Validates balance** - Ensures you have tokens to repay
3. **Approves tokens** - Allows pool to take your tokens
4. **Executes repayment** - Transfers tokens and burns debt
5. **Shows improvement** - Displays updated health factor

## Common Errors

### Error: No debt to repay

```
✅ No debt to repay!
```

**Solution:** You have no outstanding debt. This is good!

### Error: Wrong debt type

```
⚠️  No variable debt to repay!
💡 Change INTEREST_RATE_MODE in .env to match your debt type
```

**Solution:** Change `INTEREST_RATE_MODE` to match your actual debt (1 for stable, 2 for variable).

### Error: Insufficient balance

```
❌ Repayment failed!
```

**Solution:** You don't have enough tokens. Get more tokens or reduce repayment amount.

### Error code 5: No debt of matching type

```
💡 Error code 5: No debt of matching type
```

**Solution:** Your `INTEREST_RATE_MODE` doesn't match your actual debt type.

## Repayment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Full Repayment

**When to use:**
- Want to withdraw all collateral
- Tired of paying interest
- Health factor at risk

```bash
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=0
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero interest after repayment
- ✅ Can withdraw all collateral
- ✅ No liquidation risk

### Strategy 2: Partial Repayment

**When to use:**
- Improve health factor
- Keep some borrowing active
- Reduce interest burden

```bash
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=50
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Improve health factor
- ✅ Reduce interest payments
- ✅ Keep some liquidity

### Strategy 3: Interest-Only Payments

**When to use:**
- Keep principal borrowed
- Prevent interest accumulation

```bash
# Calculate accrued interest from check-balance.ts
# Then repay just that amount
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=2.5  # Just the interest
```

## Health Factor Improvement

### Before Repayment:
```
Health Factor: 1.5 ⚠️  (Risky!)
```

### After Full Repayment:
```
Health Factor: ∞ ✅ (Perfect!)
```

### After Partial Repayment:
```
Health Factor: 3.0 ✅ (Healthy!)
Improvement: +100%
```

## Understanding the Numbers

### What Gets Repaid:

- **Principal** - Original amount borrowed
- **Interest** - Accrued interest (compounds every block)
- **Total** = Principal + Interest

### Example:

```
Original borrow: 100 USDT
Time passed: 30 days
Interest rate: 5% APY
Accrued interest: ~0.41 USDT

Total to repay: 100.41 USDT
```

### When repaying "ALL":
```
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=0
```
Aave automatically calculates total debt (principal + all interest) and repays exactly that amount.

## Interest Accrual

Interest accrues **every block**:

- Variable rate: Changes based on pool utilization
- Stable rate: More predictable (but can be rebalanced)
- Compounds: Interest on interest

**Check current debt:**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.ts --network sepolia
```

## Best Practices

1. **Repay before liquidation** - Don't wait until health factor < 1.0
2. **Monitor interest** - Check debt regularly
3. **Partial repayments** - Improve health factor incrementally
4. **Full repayment before withdrawal** - Must repay all debt to withdraw all collateral
5. **Keep some buffer** - Don't use all tokens for repayment

## Tips

- 💡 **Interest rate mode matters** - Must match your debt type
- 💡 **Repay extra** - Small extra amount ensures full repayment (covers block interest)
- 💡 **Check before repaying** - Use `check-balance.ts` to see exact debt
- 💡 **Gas costs** - Factor in transaction fees
- 💡 **Timing** - Interest accrues continuously

## After Repayment

Once debt is repaid, you can:

1. **Withdraw collateral** - Use `withdraw-from-pool-configurable.ts`
2. **Borrow again** - Use `borrow-from-pool-configurable.ts`
3. **Leave it** - Keep earning interest on supplied tokens

## Next Steps

After repaying:
- ✅ **Check balance** - Use `check-balance.ts` to confirm
- ✅ **Withdraw** - Use `withdraw-from-pool-configurable.ts` if desired
- ✅ **Re-borrow** - Borrow again if needed (you have capacity)

## Related Scripts

- `borrow-from-pool-configurable.ts` - Create the debt you're now repaying
- `withdraw-from-pool-configurable.ts` - Withdraw collateral after repaying
- `check-balance.ts` - Check your debt before repaying
- `supply-to-pool-configurable.ts` - Add more collateral if needed
```

## 4. `scripts/README-WITHDRAW.md`

```markdown
# Withdraw from Pool Script

Withdraw your supplied tokens (collateral) from an Aave V2 lending pool.

## Purpose

This script allows you to:
- Withdraw supplied tokens from the pool
- Receive your principal + earned interest
- Remove collateral (if no debt or safe to do so)
- Burn aTokens and receive underlying tokens

## Prerequisites

- **Supplied tokens** - Must have aTokens (deposited collateral)
- **No debt OR safe withdrawal** - Health factor must stay above 1.0
- Configured `.env` file
- For Sepolia: ETH for gas fees

## Configuration

Set these variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Withdraw amount
TOKEN_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT=0  # 0 = withdraw all, or specify amount

# Network and addresses
NETWORK=localhost  # or 'sepolia'
LOCAL_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS=0x...
SEPOLIA_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Usage

### Full Withdrawal (All Collateral)

**⚠️ Only works if you have NO DEBT!**

```bash
# In .env:
TOKEN_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT=0

# Run script:
npx hardhat run scripts/withdraw-from-pool-configurable.ts --network localhost
# or
npx hardhat run scripts/withdraw-from-pool-configurable.ts --network sepolia
```

### Partial Withdrawal

```bash
# In .env:
TOKEN_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT=250  # Withdraw only 250 tokens

# Run script:
npx hardhat run scripts/withdraw-from-pool-configurable.ts --network sepolia
```

## What Happens

1. **Checks aToken balance** - Validates you have tokens to withdraw
2. **Checks debt** - Warns if you have outstanding debt
3. **Calculates safety** - Ensures health factor stays above 1.0
4. **Executes withdrawal** - Burns aTokens, sends underlying tokens
5. **Shows updated position** - Displays remaining collateral and health

## Common Errors

### Error: No tokens to withdraw

```
⚠️  No tokens deposited to withdraw!
💡 First supply tokens using supply-to-pool-configurable.ts
```

**Solution:** You need to supply tokens first.

### Error 35: Health factor too low

```
❌ Withdrawal failed!
💡 Error code 35: Health factor would drop below 1.0
   You must repay debt first or withdraw less!
```

**Solution:** 
- Repay some/all debt first
- Reduce `TOKEN_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT`
- Add more collateral

### Error 32: Not enough aTokens

```
💡 Error code 32: Not enough aTokens
```

**Solution:** You're trying to withdraw more than you have. Check your aToken balance.

### Error 33: Not enough liquidity

```
💡 Error code 33: Not enough liquidity in the pool
```

**Solution:** The pool doesn't have enough tokens. Wait or withdraw less.

## Withdrawal Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Debt - Full Withdrawal ✅

```
Supplied: 500 USDT
Debt: 0 USDT
Health Factor: ∞

→ Can withdraw: ALL (500 USDT)
```

**Safe!** No risk.

### Scenario 2: Small Debt - Partial Withdrawal ✅

```
Supplied: 500 USDT
Debt: 100 USDT
Health Factor: 4.25
LTV: 75%

→ Can safely withdraw: ~133 USDT
→ Leaves: 367 USDT collateral
→ New health factor: ~2.62
```

**Safe!** Health factor stays above 2.0.

### Scenario 3: High Debt - Risky Withdrawal ⚠️

```
Supplied: 500 USDT
Debt: 350 USDT
Health Factor: 1.21
LTV: 75%

→ Cannot withdraw without repaying first!
```

**Risky!** Must repay debt first.

## Safety Guidelines

### If You Have NO Debt:

- ✅ Withdraw anytime
- ✅ Withdraw any amount
- ✅ No liquidation risk

### If You Have Debt:

Calculate **maximum safe withdrawal**:

```
Max Withdrawal = (Total Collateral × LTV - Total Debt) / Token Price
```

**Example:**
```
Collateral: $500 (500 USDT)
Debt: $100
LTV: 75%
Token Price: $1

Max Withdrawal = (500 × 0.75 - 100) / 1
              = 275 USDT

Keep health factor above 2.0 for safety:
Recommended: Withdraw max 175 USDT
```

## Interest Earned

You receive **more tokens** than you deposited:

```
Deposited: 500 USDT
Time: 30 days
APY: 3%
Interest earned: ~1.23 USDT

Withdrawal: 501.23 USDT ✨
```

## Best Practices

1. **Repay debt first** - Full withdrawal requires zero debt
2. **Keep health factor > 2.0** - If you have debt
3. **Withdraw gradually** - Test with small amounts first
4. **Check pool liquidity** - Ensure pool has tokens available
5. **Calculate safety** - Use `check-balance.ts` to verify

## Withdrawal Strategies

### Strategy 1: Full Exit

**Steps:**
1. Repay all debt (`repay-loan-configurable.ts`)
2. Withdraw all collateral (this script)

```bash
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=0
TOKEN_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT=0
```

### Strategy 2: Reduce Exposure

**Steps:**
1. Withdraw partial amount
2. Keep some collateral earning interest

```bash
TOKEN_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT=250  # Withdraw half
```

### Strategy 3: Rebalance

**Steps:**
1. Withdraw from one token
2. Supply to another token

## Tips

- 💡 **Check liquidity first** - Run `list-pool-reserves.ts`
- 💡 **You earn interest** - aToken balance > original deposit
- 💡 **Time value** - The longer deposited, the more interest
- 💡 **No penalties** - No fees for withdrawing
- 💡 **Instant** - Withdrawals are immediate (no lock-up)

## Health Factor Impact

### Before Withdrawal:
```
Collateral: 500 USDT ($0.285 ETH)
Debt: 100 USDT ($0.057 ETH)
Health Factor: 4.25 ✅
```

### After Withdrawing 200 USDT:
```
Collateral: 300 USDT ($0.171 ETH)
Debt: 100 USDT ($0.057 ETH)
Health Factor: 2.55 ✅ Still safe
```

### After Withdrawing 400 USDT:
```
Collateral: 100 USDT ($0.057 ETH)
Debt: 100 USDT ($0.057 ETH)
Health Factor: 0.85 ❌ LIQUIDATION!
```

## Complete Workflow

### Exit Everything:

```bash
# 1. Check position
npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.ts --network sepolia

# 2. Repay all debt
TOKEN_REPAY_AMOUNT=0
npx hardhat run scripts/repay-loan-configurable.ts --network sepolia

# 3. Withdraw all collateral
TOKEN_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT=0
npx hardhat run scripts/withdraw-from-pool-configurable.ts --network sepolia
```

## Next Steps

After withdrawing:
- ✅ **Check balance** - Verify tokens received
- ✅ **Re-supply** - Supply again if desired
- ✅ **Different token** - Supply a different token

## Related Scripts

- `supply-to-pool-configurable.ts` - Supply tokens (reverse of this)
- `repay-loan-configurable.ts` - Must repay before full withdrawal
- `check-balance.ts` - Check position before withdrawing
- `list-pool-reserves.ts` - Check pool liquidity
```
